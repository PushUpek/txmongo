Status and History
==================

TxMongo was created by `Alexandre Fiori <https://github.com/fiorix>`_ who developed it during the years 2009-2010.
From 2010 and onwards mainly bug fixes were added, as Alexandre entered maintenance mode with many contributions being made by others.
Development picked back up in 2014 by `Bret Curtis <https://github.com/psi29a>`_ with Alexandre's consent and was migrated to Twisted where it is a first-party Twisted library.
TxMongo can be found here:

The MongoDB client library functionality is in active use.
It is stable and works very well.
